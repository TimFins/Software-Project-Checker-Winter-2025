# Testing the binary search tree checker
By now, you have learned what a checker is and how it is built using a basic example. In the next step, we will test a checker in action by solving exercises related to binary search trees which are evaluated by a checker.

To begin, open the following URL in your browser
https://jack3-core-01.inf.hochschule-trier.de/frankfurt-uas/editor/myWorkspace.xhtml.
Log in using the account credentials provided to you on paper. Each participant has their own account, so please use only yours.

After logging in, navigate to the menu bar and select the tab “Available Courses.” In this view, open the folder “Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences” → “Algorithms & Datastructures”, and then choose the course “Binary Search Tree.”

You will now see a list of different exercises related to binary search trees. You can start with any of them. Try solving a task and observe the feedback you receive. To better understand how the checker responds, you may also want to intentionally make mistakes and see what kind of feedback is generated.

Take some time to experiment with the exercises. This will give you a clearer picture of how a checker works in practice and how detailed feedback can guide students in identifying and correcting their mistakes.

# Python Introduction
If you have not worked with Python before or need to refresh some skills, then we recommend getting to know the basics of Python.

For this project, relatively basic knowledge of general language syntax, classes and data types should be sufficient. 
There will be no need for more complex concepts such as concurrent programming or external libraries beyond the three installed (which you should not have to interact with anyways).

We have created this Python introduction [https://jensliebehenschel.github.io/ShortPythonIntro/en/](https://jensliebehenschel.github.io/ShortPythonIntro/en/), which you can access online to learn the most important knowledge required for the project. There you can even run Python code directly inside the webpage. Or you copy & paste the small exercises and work locally. You will not necessarily need every detail mentioned in said introduction, so you may choose which contents you would rather skip or read up on.

There are also many other resources for learning Python, such as YouTube tutorials or other websites.

How you prepare is up to you.
